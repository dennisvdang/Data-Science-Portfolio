## Case Studies

### App Store Case Study
- Investigated if Apple Store apps received better reviews than Google Play apps.
- Followed the Data Science Pipeline: Sourcing, Cleaning, Modeling, Evaluating.
- Conducted a Permutation test for hypothesis testing.
- Concluded that platform impacts ratings, recommending Google Play.
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy.

### Clustering (Wine Customers Case Study)
- Explored customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.
- Conducted data wrangling, K-Means clustering, and visualized clusters with PCA.
- Used the Elbow, Silhouette, and Gap statistic methods to choose K.
- Analyzed and visualized cluster distributions for different features.
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### Cosine Similarity
- Used cosine similarity to compare numeric data and text datasets.
- Calculated similarity measures for sentences/paragraphs.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-learn.

### Decision Tree (Coffee Case Study)
-Explored decision tree modeling to predict customer purchases of a new specialty coffee product.
- Analyzed decision paths and feature importance to understand key drivers of customer purchasing behavior.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- Compared the performance of a single decision tree model to a Random Forest ensemble model.
- Concluded that the single decision tree provided better predictive performance than the more complex Random Forest model, highlighting the importance of tailoring the model to the specific dataset.
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

### Euclidean and Manhattan Distance
- Demonstrated the calculation and comparison of Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
- Visualized the distribution of distances through histograms.
- Highlighted the application of these distance measures in data science, foundational for algorithms like PCA.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### Frequentist Inference
- Applied Frequentist inference to real-world data, addressing practical business questions for a hospital, emphasizing statistical concepts like z-statistic, t-statistic, Central Limit Theorem, and confidence intervals.
- Explored the Central Limit Theorem and its implications.
- Estimated population mean and standard deviation from a sample.
- Calculated confidence intervals.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
