# Springboard Guided Capstone Project

*Submitted by Dennis Dang*

This repository contains the Springboard Guided Capstone project, which focuses on optimizing ski ticket pricing for Big Mountain Resort. The goal is to develop a data-driven pricing model to increase revenue for the 2024 snow season.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured data science methodology:

1. **Data Wrangling**: Clean and preprocess the dataset of 330 ski resorts.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigate patterns and relationships in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to provide additional insights.
4. **Modeling**: Develop and evaluate predictive models for ticket pricing.

## Repository Structure

  - `03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory analysis and visualizations.
  - `04_preprocessing_and_training.ipynb`: Feature engineering and model training.
  - `05_modeling.ipynb`: Model evaluation and selection.
- `data/`: Contains the cleaned ski resort dataset.
- `models/`: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- `Big Mountain Resort Slides.pptx`: Presentation slides summarizing the project findings and recommendations.
- `Guided Capstone Project Report.pdf`: Detailed project report covering the entire data science process and results.

## Key Findings

- The Random Forest Regressor was selected as the best model due to its superior performance and robustness.
- Factors such as number of ski lifts, runs, and snow making capabilities significantly influence ticket pricing.
- Recommendations include investing in resort improvements and adjusting pricing based on the model's insights.
